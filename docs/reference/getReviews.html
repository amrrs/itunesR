Flipkart delivers you low quality brand for your product. When they are listing product then it shows quality brand product but when you get delivery you get different product even after returning the product you will get different brand. So it’s wastage of your time and money and most importantly space on your mobile devices. \nDon’t download the app. \nIf CEO wants to take some action please. That will be great help for customers. Lot of people facing this problem.

Customer service is also getting bad day by day. Better remove this crap from app store.

Received different product, to return it i have to try 1000 times still the app wont work fine. After giving all bank details “confirm return” is still in hide mode. I dont want my money in any wallet but my bank acc. Kindly improve ur app performance. Very annoying.

So my opinion  for this app is to bad.

I generally bought from the genuine sites, but not expected this from flipkart. I bought a mobile from flipkart, I am facing issue with mike and voice. I have raised a return request to flipkart. Every time flipkart technicians visit to my place and he is said everything is ok. Then I gave the proof in which I am talking to flipkart toll free number and other is with one of the technicians. Still they are saying we can't approve as its out of our return policy. But I have already raised the my complains before the time and tech visit is done for that. They should understand if someone have already raised complain before the time they should replace the mobile and not provide this stupid reasons. Worst quality with low level of management and customer care support.

Such a cheap service from you having head quarters in Karnataka and you don’t provide service in kannada language and delaying deliveries. Such a irritating customer service from your end

In 7days the replacement was cancelled. It cost of Rs.350 now its a loss to me. Dont Order in Flipkart.

Only thing they know is saying "sorry". I m facing problems from past 2 years. Now finally I m gonna uninstall this app and I will never use any Flipkart service in future.

And I've cancelled it at the same date. There after they have sent an email that says "your refund has been completed and it will reflect to your account on 6th of October.\n\nBut 1 week back I've received SMS from my bank that says my bank will debit emi for that product. Suddenly I've contacted to Flipkart customer care and they said that "we will escalate your issue and call back before 28th of October 2017. They have called back at 28th October and said that "refund has been completed at our end and if it's not reflected to your account please contact your bank".\n\nThen I've called to my bank customer care and they said that "Flipkart hasn't initiated your refund" and ask me to send an email to them to check with Flipkart backend team.\n\nAnd now I am waiting for the solution.\n\nIn this bad experience surely I am saying that Flipkart is 100% Fraud and they r doing cheating business.

With a wide range of diversified products in a “cart”, the wheels of the cart seems to be dislodging one after another. I have brought so many products, from a MacBook to Story-books, but recently the service seems to be really worst. The company should remember that its marketplace is accepted because of only the service it provides. Playing loose with its competitive advantage can prove costly. Kindly, improve the delivery and after sale services.
#&gt; 49 I had ordered a home-centre shoe rack. The delivery was on time but when the installation guy opened the box to install, most of the planks had a cracked sunmica fitted on it !! He himself took pictures of it and raised a complaint and went away without installing!! I also raised a complaint from my side , this was on 1st October !! Today is 29th October but still the issue is unresolved !! Flipkart team did not even bother to revert back with any solution about the issue!! Inspire of me calling and mailing them again and again !!  The request showed "on hold" !! And they have only one reply to it that they are forwarding the issue to concern team... who the f#*$ is this concern team which is not concerned at all!!! \nToday also I called them and they have same thing to tell me .. this time they have again placed a request !! So probably I have to wait another month !! And when I checked  on to my app the status of my request is shown as "rejected" !! \nWow !!\nSo they sell defective products and cheat customers and don't even pay heed to the complaints ! Very convenient for them !! \n\nMy sincere request to all other fellow consumers/customers that please don't buy anything on flipkart !! Don't take any chances !! \nYou have better options like #amazon !!
